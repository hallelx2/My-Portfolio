## Halleluyah Darasimi Oludele Portfolio

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Sentiment Analysis of Emotions: Developed a model to analyse emotions in tweets to understand the user psyche. Went on to develop a web app that can take respective tweets and analyse them for trends in emotional patterns. Won honourable mentions at the Cohere AI Hackathon. [Here](https://devpost.com/software/internal-health)
- Web Data Mining: Created a python script that scrapes a website and uses Gemini API to create a more concise and storylike version, specifically tailored for people with ADHD. [Here](https://github.com/hallelx2/gemini-ai-hackathon)

2. Computer Vision:
- Object Detection and Recognition: Develop a model to detect and classify various waste materials and also a model to classify different plastic bottles for a robotic arm. [Here](https://github.com/hallelx2/Soda-Can-Detection)

3. Time Series Analysis:
- Financial Data Analysis: Analyse and forecast trends in financial markets using time series data. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/oludelehalleluyah/economics-data-analysis-with-python/edit)

4. Healthcare Analytics:
- Drug Discovery and Development: Use machine learning techniques to accelerate the discovery and development of new pharmaceutical drugs. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/oludelehalleluyah/corona-virus-drug-discovery-data-processing)
- Breast Cancer Prediction App: A web app that uses machine learning models to predict whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant. (In progress)

5. Other Projects
- Worked on a team to coordinate the building of a chrome extension for patients with ADHD that can take in the contents of a website and generate a more concise version and summary of the website. This was for the Gemini Ultra Hackathon. Project link
- Automation Tools for Tableau: Developed an automation tool named "Marketeer" to scrape data and publish it to Tableau, streamlining data visualisation processes. This was for the Tableau DataDev Hackathon. Portfolio link
- Robotic Arm with the Capability to Sort Waste. This was built for the UI/UNILAG Design Competition
- Expenses Web App: Currently building an expenses web app using Django, enabling users to input expenses into a database and view analysis through a web interface, enhancing personal finance management, also equipping it with ML algorithms to predict future expenses and trends. Soon
